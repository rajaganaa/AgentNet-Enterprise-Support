![Kaggle AI Agents Intensive](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-AI%20Agents%20Intensive-blue)

## Description
This is a capstone project for the Kaggle AI Agents Intensive. AgentNet is an autonomous agent designed to triage enterprise support tickets, search for answers, and self-correct its own responses using reflection patterns. It leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate and helpful support.

## Tech Stack
- **LangGraph**: For building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **LLMs**: Utilizing Large Language Models for reasoning and generation.
- **Google Generative AI**: For accessing Gemini models.
- **DuckDuckGo Search**: For retrieving real-time information.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains the main agent prototype notebook (`agent_prototype.ipynb`).
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.

## Getting Started
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Open `notebooks/agent_prototype.ipynb` to explore the agent's implementation.
